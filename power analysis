Power analysis allows you to determine the sample size required to detect an
effect of a given size with a given degree of confidence. Conversely, it allows you to
determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of
confidence, under sample size constraints. If the probability is unacceptably low,
you’d be wise to alter or abandon the experiment.

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to conduct power analyses for a variety of statistical
tests, including tests of proportions, t-tests, chi-square tests, balanced one-way
ANOVA, tests of correlations, and linear models. Because power analysis applies to
hypothesis testing situations, we’ll start with a brief review of null hypothesis significance
testing (NHST).


In statistical hypothesis testing, you specify a hypothesis about a population parameter
(your null hypothesis, or H0). You then draw a sample from this population and calculate
a statistic that’s used to make inferences about the population parameter.
Assuming that the null hypothesis is true, you calculate the probability of obtaining
the observed sample statistic or one more extreme. If the probability is sufficiently
small, you reject the null hypothesis in favor of its opposite (referred to as the alternative
or research hypothesis, H1).

An example will clarify the process. Say you’re interested in evaluating the impact
of cell phone use on driver reaction time. Your null hypothesis is Ho: μ1 – μ2 = 0,
where μ1 is the mean response time for drivers using a cell phone and μ2 is the mean
response time for drivers that are cell phone free (here, μ1 – μ2 is the population
parameter of interest). If you reject this null hypothesis, you’re left with the alternate
or research hypothesis, namely H1: μ1 – μ2 ≠ 0. This is equivalent to μ1 ≠ μ2, that the
mean reaction times for the two conditions are not equal.
